# Hot Potatoes
This work was inspired by [this article](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/etfs/article-hot-vs-passive-potato-portfolios-which-delivers-the-best-return/) which described a hot potato portfolio.
## Potato Portfolios
The name is inspired by the idea of the couch potato portfolio. This is an investing approach widely discussed online which encourages in investing in index tracking ETFs and holding for the long term. By contrast, the hot potato approach suggested that we should take the same ETF basket (in this case suggested as Canadian stocks, Canadian bonds, US stocks, and internation stocks) and, each month, invest all money in the ETF which had the highest total return over the last 12 months.
## Problem Statement
The idea seemed interesting but I thought there was a decent chance that I might forget to collect the needed info at the end of every month. The purpose of this code is to collect 1-year total returns from Yahoo Finance.
