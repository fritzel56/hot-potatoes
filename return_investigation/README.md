# Return Investigation

I wanted to make sure I understood how the total returns are calculated. To do this, I pulled historical total return data from Vanguard and tried to calculate them using daily historical data from Yahoo Finance. All analysis was done on VCN.TO. It was not chosen for a specific reason.

## File Overview
